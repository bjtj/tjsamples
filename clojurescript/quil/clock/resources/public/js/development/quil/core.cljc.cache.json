The noise value can be\n  animated by moving through the noise space and the 2nd and 3rd\n  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.\n\n  The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in\n  respect to the function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept\n  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several\n  octaves which are added together for the final result.\n\n  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the\n  scale of the input coordinates. As the function works within an\n  infinite space the value of the coordinates doesn't matter as such,\n  only the distance between successive coordinates does (eg. when\n  using noise within a loop). As a general rule the smaller the\n  difference between coordinates, the smoother the resulting noise\n  sequence will be. Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most\n  applications, but this will differ depending on use."],"~$push-style",["^ ","^Q","Structure","^R",null,"^S",["^ ","^Q","Structure","^T","push()","^U","1.0","^V",null,"^W","/home/tj/dev/git/tjsamples/clojure/quil/clock/resources/public/js/development/quil/core.cljc","^X",13,"^Y","pushStyle()","^Z",3,"^[",true,"^10",3134,"^11",3134,"^12",["^13",["^14",["^13",[[]]]]],"^16","Saves the current style settings onto a 'style stack'.

# Why Do JavaScript Test Frameworks Use describe() and beforeEach()? #

https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/why-do-javascript-test-frameworks-use-describe-and-beforeeach/

> The describe()/beforeEach()/it() convention originated with the Ruby testing library [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), and is often referred to as spec-style. Just like in the JavaScript test libraries above, RSpec lets you declare tests by calls to it(), nested inside describe()s and with optional beforeEach() calls. The other major convention is test-style and is inspired by [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit5/), the Java library that first popularized unit testing. In JUnit, tests are just plain methods that have a test prefix or a @Test annotation.
